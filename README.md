## Overview
[BumbleBot](https://twitter.com/bumblebot) is a Twitter bot created using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Processing]((http://processing.org/)) to post procedurally generated bumblebees.

Originally written as a standalone Processing sketch to explore insect anatomy, it continues to generate accurate bee structures (its bumblebees have slight anatomical variations based on gender; see the antennae, hind legs and abdomen segments for example).

Future enhancements will include interactivity and procedurally generated names based on colour, gender, etc., as well as generating other types of bee (i.e. honey and solitary bees).

## Inspiration
Although not affiliated with any organisation, BumbleBot has been inspired by the work of the [Bumblebee Conservation Trust](http://bumblebeeconservation.org/), [IBRA](http://www.ibrabee.org.uk/) and Buglife's [Urban Buzz](https://www.buglife.org.uk/urban-buzz/) project, as well as [@mothgenerator](https://twitter.com/mothgenerator) by Katie Rose Pipkin and Loren Schmidt.
