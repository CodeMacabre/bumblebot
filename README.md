# Bumblebot
[Bumblebot](https://twitter.com/bumblebot) is a Twitter bot created using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Processing]((http://processing.org/)) to post images of procedurally generated bumblebees.

Although not affiliated with any organisation, Bumblebot has been inspired by the work of the [Bumblebee Conservation Trust](http://bumblebeeconservation.org/), [IBRA](http://www.ibrabee.org.uk/) and Buglife's [Urban Buzz](https://www.buglife.org.uk/urban-buzz/) project, as well as [@moth generator](https://twitter.com/mothgenerator) by Katie Rose Pipkin and Loren Schmidt.

BumbleBot is currently in prototype phase (v0.1.6) and is not yet live.
